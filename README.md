# Playlist
This program introduces list and heap-based-memory.
At first a new header file is made. Whereas the functions returns the previously node from n pointer. The next inserts the node at n, next returns the number of node in the list. The next return the pointer to n node. The next deletes the node at n, if the node is at the start, the whole list moves, so the new head will be the next in the list. The node is also being freed, using free function. The last function return the pointer of the last pointer. In main.c we fistly defines our 2 in and out files. We start by removing a newline, by checking if the last char minus 1 is \n, if true we change it to \0. Next function load_file() we open our in-file and read every line and use malloc to make a node, and after use malloc again to make the node possible to have data. We the copy the line from our file into our node, and insert is at the end of or list.
In save_file() we opens a new file and make it writeable. We then for prints every node in it. In print_tracks we print our list in terminal.
In main(), we start by calling our load_file() and prints our current playlist in terminal. We the deletes the 5th node og free it. We after put a new node into the 4th position and calls the save_file(), where we print in a new file called PLAYLIST_OUT_PATH.
